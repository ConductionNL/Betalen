Betaal Service / BC
-------
The Payment Component (Betalen Component) handles, preferably in collaboration with the Order Registration Component (Orderregistratie Component). To this end, it creates invoices and reports them (if desired) to a payment provider. Finally, the results of the payment provider are processed, creating an invoice overview that can be used by both the organization and customers.

If desired, the Payment Component, in collaboration with the WRC (templates), BS (mail and SMS) and the Queue Component, can be used to follow up payments in the form of reminders and exhortation.

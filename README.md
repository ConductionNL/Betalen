# Betaal Service / BC

Description
----
The Payment Component (Betalen Component) handles, preferably in collaboration with the Order Registration Component (Orderregistratie Component). To this end, it creates invoices and reports them (if desired) to a payment provider. Finally, the results of the payment provider are processed, creating an invoice overview that can be used by both the organization and customers.

If desired, the Payment Component, in collaboration with the WRC (templates), BS (mail and SMS) and the Queue Component, can be used to follow up payments in the form of reminders and exhortation.

Installation
----
We differentiate between two way's of installing this component, a local installation as part of the provided developers toolkit or an [helm](https://helm.sh/) installation on an development or production environment. 

#### Local installation
First make sure you have [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) running on your computer. Then clone the repository to a directory on your local machine through a [git command](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone) or [git kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) (ui for git). If successful you can now navigate to the directory of your cloned repository in a command prompt and execute docker-compose up. 
```CLI
$ docker-compose up
```
This will build the docker image and run the used containers and when seeing the log from the php container: "NOTICE: ready to handle connections", u are ready to view the documentation at localhost on your preferred browser.

#### Instalation on Kubernetes or Haven
As a haven compliant commonground component this component is installable on kubernetes trough helm. The helm files can be found in the api/helm folder. For installing this component trough helm simply open your (still) favorite command line interface and run 
```CLI
$ helm install [name] ./api/helm --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml --namespace [name] --set settings.env=prod,settings.debug=0,settings.cache=1
```
For an in depth installation guide you can refer to the [installation guide](INSTALLATION.md), it also contains a short tutorial on getting your cluster ready to expose your installation to the world

Developers toolkit and technical information

We make our datamodels with the tool [modelio](https://www.modelio.org) which can be found along the OAS documentation and the postman collection in api/public/schema.
If you need development support we provide that through the [samenorganiseren slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/samenorganiseren/shared_invite/zt-dex1d7sk-wy11sKYWCF0qQYjJHSMW5Q).

Couple of quick tips when you start developing
